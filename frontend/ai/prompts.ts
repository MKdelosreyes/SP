Task:
Explain why the correct meaning is correct and why the selected choice is wrong. 

Output 4 bullets:
1) Why the correct answer is correct (use the definition). 
2) Why the selected choice is wrong (explain the difference or trap).
3) A quick vocabulary/grammar note (one sentence).
4) A time-pressure tip (one sentence).`;

  return `You are a helpful Filipino language coach for UPCAT prep.

Facts you MUST use:
- Correct word: ${correct}
- Official definition: ${definition}
- Example sentence: ${example}
- Student submitted: "${selected}"

Task:
The student filled in the blank incorrectly. Analyze their answer step-by-step:

1) First, determine if "${selected}" is a valid Filipino word or gibberish/typo.
2) If it's gibberish or a typo:
   - Say it's not a valid Filipino word. 
   - Point out the correct word is "${correct}" which means "${definition}".
   - If it's a near-miss spelling of "${correct}", mention the spelling error.
3) If it's a real Filipino word but wrong:
   - Briefly state what "${selected}" means. 
   - Explain why it doesn't fit the sentence context.
   - Clarify why "${correct}" (${definition}) is the right fit. 

Output 4 bullets:
1) Why "${correct}" is the correct answer (use the definition and sentence context).
2) Is the submitted answer a valid word? If yes, what does it mean?  If no, say it's invalid/gibberish.
3) A quick vocabulary/grammar note (one sentence).
4) A time-pressure tip (one sentence, e.g., use context clues or word roots).`;
